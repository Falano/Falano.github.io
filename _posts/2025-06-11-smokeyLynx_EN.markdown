## Lynx
Pictures of lynx. Lynx have very long legs and very wide feet. So that they sink less in the snow, and, when they do, so that they can hope to see above it. I find their shape fascinating.\
So: smoked lynx. They're about 25cm (8 inches) in total, about 10 x 10 x 5cm (about 3 x 3 x 2 inches).\
The white spots are technically incorrect (lynx spots are smaller and darker instead of light) but I like how they look.
