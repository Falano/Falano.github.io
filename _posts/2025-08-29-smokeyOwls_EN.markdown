## Owls
Ceramics of owls. Some are smoked, others glazed and more stylized.
I was disappointed by the to-be-smoked ones when they left the kiln (white) but once smoked they're probably my favorites.

### Smoked
The ones with their wings out are 15 to 20cm (6-7 inches) in the widest dimension.

### Glazed, stylized

Those ones are about 5cm tall (2 inches)
