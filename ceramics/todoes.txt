## Series: 
	closed loop body
	bodies in contact (like lulial; cat on horse; bird on buffalo; humans? a lot of human/animal ideas (fingers touching a dog's snout or neck; cat on lap or chest; bird on shoulder or in arms; horse under seat or neck touching hand; snake on arm; etc)
	wet river rock color with only half hidden painting - chicken dinosaur, fossil snail nautilus ammonites, horse pegasus, were wolf, snake drake, horse unicorn for Jade - dry: black and -dark and light-, wet: -black and dark- and light
	okay but bisons (and any wooly animal really; camels, mountain goats, whatevs) shedding wool and being half wooly half furry has amazing texture. Glaze for wool clay for fur? (visual ref: https://thegreatprinceoftheforest.tumblr.com/post/756200606871470080/plains-bison-bryan-maynes)
	¿wet river rock color with text? (what text?)
	¿bodies w trans millipedes? (need a stronger series, just one sculpt is not enough) (what are those bodies doing? Except being covered in images of bugs)
	¿body parts? (I forgot what this was supposed to be. Just studies? Human or animal?)

## Tinies:
	¿test sandwich clay-engobe-clay, with the bad ones and the new ones? If I ever want to use the bad ones ever again. Which. Is not a certainty.
	¿tiny turtles - with naked limbs and glazed top -glazed bottom?
	dendrobates, micro-drakes-like
