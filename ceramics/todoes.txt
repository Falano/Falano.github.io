	Lynx B scratching (let's assume lynx A is definitely never gonna be okay again)
	snowleo D reaching up (currently fired but broken)
	owl C? threatening

# ToDo, Ideas:
## Snowwalkers Feet:
	¿Ptarmigans?
	¿Muskoxen?

## Clay-colored:
	make another two three-part Lulial, for time
	¿muscardin volant / orange painted bat ; also: indian flying fox?
	¿gray horse, raccoon, mouflon, serpent coral, reindeer, mucca, sable antelope -nw, nyala -striped antelope, red panda, manchot empereur, macareux moine, red-crowned crane, fox, squirrel, chipmunk, purus red howler -rn monkey, coconut octopus -rnw, giant Pacific octopus -rw, red or fire salamander, tiger, tamarin lion, giraffe, orang-outan, prevost's squirrel -nwr, ribbon seal -nw, loggerhead sea turtle -rw, narwhal ??, red-throated loon -red throat and white speckles on black wings, monarch butterfly, carcajou?, ivory-billed woodpecker, tiger quoll?

## Biblical Accuracy:
	With Mouth: Owl, Possum, Raven, Croco (Tasm);
	With -Rump- Eyes: Panther, Deer, Genetta, Ball Python, Owl? Hyena? Spotted Ray? Dendrobate?;
	With -Head- Eyes: Orca, Panda, Pygmy Owl, Sand Lizard, Toad?;
	With Horns: Sheep, Rhino, Deer, Grand Duc -oreilles?, grand koudou, hare -ears;
	With Slices: Zebra, Tasm, Mongoose, Numbat, Owl?;
	With -Longbody- Many Legs: Stoat, Otarie, Lizard;
	With -Shortbody- Many Legs: Monkey, Horse? Owl -wings?; Jacana -baby legs
	With Face: Owl, Fox, gattopardo, sloth, hare

## Series: 
	closed loop body
	bodies in contact (like lulial but actually fired together; cat on horse; bird on buffalo; humans? a lot of human/animal ideas (fingers touching a dog's snout or neck; cat on lap or chest; bird on shoulder or in arms; horse under seat or neck touching hand; snake on arm; etc)
	wet river rock color with only half hidden painting - chicken dinosaur, fossil snail nautilus ammonites, horse pegasus, were wolf, snake drake, horse unicorn for Jade - dry: black and -dark and light-, wet: -black and dark- and light
	okay but bisons (and any wooly animal really; camels, mountain goats, whatevs) shedding wool and being half wooly half furry has amazing texture. Glaze for wool clay for fur? (visual ref: https://thegreatprinceoftheforest.tumblr.com/post/756200606871470080/plains-bison-bryan-maynes)
	¿wet river rock color with text? (what text?)
	¿bodies w trans millipedes? (need a stronger series, just one sculpt is not enough) (what are those bodies doing? Except being covered in images of bugs) (butterfly over your face, covering your eyes with their camouflage ones? horseshoes on your torso.)
	¿body parts? (I forgot what this was supposed to be. Just studies? Human or animal?)(okay probably this was the human anatomy one: lung cage in white bone with red (or black?) flesh/skin and black (or red) (if black can be just a bit overfired and shiny and overripe-soft-shaped) guts; also: le bassin containing guts; clavicles; lungs; heart; wrist bones that kiss (veins! in black))

## Tinies:
	¿test sandwich clay-engobe-clay, with the bad ones and the new ones? If I ever want to use the bad ones ever again. Which. Is not a certainty.
	¿tiny turtles - with naked limbs and glazed top -glazed bottom?
	dendrobates, micro-drakes-like
