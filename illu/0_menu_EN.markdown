# 2D
- to get pictures of what I make sent directly to your inbox or RSS feed reader, subscribe to the [newsletter](https://forms.gle/sVFdmqG9m2JGmU4HA) or the blog articles' [RSS feed](https://falano.github.io/feed/ceramics.xml); I'll also use it to announce fairs, exhibitions and sales drops. I'm not producing a lot for now, so they're shared between 2D and ceramics.
- If you want to buy things, head on to [my shop](https://nolanfa-shop.fourthwall.com/) (not always open)
- to contact me, you can use **nolanfa. art (at) gmail. com**
